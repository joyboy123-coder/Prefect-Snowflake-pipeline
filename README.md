# Prefect-Snowflake-pipeline

If you want to create a `requirements.txt` for your Prefect-Snowflake pipeline, you should include at least the following (based on typical Prefect and Snowflake usage):

```txt
prefect
pandas
snowflake-connector-python
python-dotenv
```

You may also want to add any other libraries you use in your ETL scripts (such as numpy, logging, etc., if used).

Would you like me to create a `requirements.txt` file for your Prefect-Snowflake workspace? If so, please confirm the exact dependencies you want, or let me know if you want me to detect them from your code.
